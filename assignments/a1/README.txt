In order to run the program you just need to have python installed in your machine, after that you just run in the console

$ python assignment1.py

The program will save the plots by default in the path where you execute the program, but if you don't want to save them you (and for better visualization also) you can run the program with the 'show' parameter which will show the plots one by one when the script is running.

$ python assignment1.py show
